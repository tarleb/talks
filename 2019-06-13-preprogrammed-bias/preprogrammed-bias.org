* Major Histocompatibility Complex
  
** MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex)

   #+BEGIN_notes
   - Central part of immune system
   - Graft rejection

** MHC variance matters
   
   #+BEGIN_notes
   Low intra-population variance can lead to problems

** MHC influences reproduction

   - The smell of MHC can induce spontaneous aborts
     (https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.6857281)
   - Eggs select sperms for MHC diversity

** In Humans, too

  #+BEGIN_notes
  Different MHC profile is preferred

** The modern world doesn't change this
   #+BEGIN_notes

** No, men are not immune
- But don't care quite as much about MHC

  https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1997.0204
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2004.11.005
- Related but different: men can smell ovulation
  https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797609357733
  
  #+BEGIN_notes
  Testosterone increases if men smell fertile women
  #+END_notes
  
* So...?
  
** Thinks to keep in mind

   - It never hurts to know the source of some biases
   - Biology still has a strong impact on us
   - There are biases which your didn't even know about

   #+BEGIN_notes
   It's good to know that acceptance/preference of more aggressive persons
   depending on their sex might have been programmed into us by evolution.
