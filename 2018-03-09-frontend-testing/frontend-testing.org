#+title: Frontend Testing
#+subtitle: A newbie's notes

* What's cooking? 
** Fair warning

- Tests are bae. ♥
- I'm a testing noob.
- This is only an overview.
- Interrupt and correct me when I'm wrong!
- There's a reason we have people exclusively focusing on testing.

  
* What can we test?

** Defining boundaries: What's "frontend"?
- Interface between the user and the back end.
- HTML, CSS and every-increasing amounts of JS.
- Used to be depleted of logic.

*Oversimplified*: everything that happens in the browser.
  
#+BEGIN_notes
Frontend in the webdev sense.

Out of scope:
- Backend logic
- API behavior
#+END_notes

** What can we test?                                               :noexport:
- Measure page load times.
- Check render speed.
- Verify visual changes.
- Ensure usability, design, orthography, etc.

#+BEGIN_notes
The last point is sometimes referred to as /visual testing/ or /manual testing/.
But /visual testing/ is also used to describe the process of recording visual
steps to reproduce an issue.

** Performance

- PageSpeed ::
  - good performance indicator;
  - offers suggestion on how to improve;
  - includes many points relevant to backend devs.

- Phantomas ::
  - PhantomJS-based web performance metrics tool;
  - can check many timing, sizing, and counting metrics.

** Visual regression
- Wraith ::
  - Take screenshots;
  - produce visual diffs;
  - requires PhantomJS/Headless Chrome/Slimer

- BackstopJS ::
  - can also simulate user interaction.

** Logic-focused JavaScript functions
- Mocha
- Chai
- Sinon   
- Jasmine
- ⋮

** That's it?

** CasperJS                                                        :noexport:
- Test scripted actions;
- uses PhantomJS;
- can change screen sizes;
- allows to automate complex user actions.


* Browser automation

** PhantomJS
   
 [[file:./phantomjs-logo.png]]

- Headless, pure JS browser emulator
- Plenty of wrappers (most notably: CasperJS)
- Not a real browser

** Selenium
   
 [[file:./selenium.png]]
   
- Testing-framework for web applications
- can be used to setup a grid to run tests concurrently;
- has plenty of wrappers, including cloud services.

** WebDriver

- It's a protocol for browser automation;
- allows introspection and control of user agents;
- was pioneered by Selenium.

** WebDriver wrappers

- WebdriverIO

- Nightwatch

  #+ATTR_HTML: :height 100px
  [[file:./nightwatch.png]]

- Protractor

  #+ATTR_HTML: :height 100px

* Other test things

** Useful programs

- Karma :: runs tests and reports test results.
- Appium :: selenium for mobile
- Espresso :: test android apps

** Results formats
- JUnit :: report format for (failing) tests
- Clover :: format for test coverage

** Cloud services
- Saucelabs
- Browser stack
